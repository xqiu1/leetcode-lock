/**
 * [HARD]
 * 
 * Given an array consisting of n integers,
 * find the contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to k that
 * has the maximum average value.
 * And you need to output the maximum average value.
 * 
 * Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
 * Output: 12.75
 * Explanation:
 * when length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,
 * when length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.
 * Thus return 12.75.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 1. 1 <= k <= n <= 10,000
 * 2. Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000]
